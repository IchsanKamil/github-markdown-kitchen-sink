 <summary>The Details disclosure element</summary>
<br>

> The HTML Details Element (`<details>`) creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using the `<summary>` element.
> 
> A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. If the first child of the `<details>` element is a `<summary>`, the contents of the `<summary>` element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.
